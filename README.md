# get_next_line

edit : this version is BAD like really BAD please do not use it in serious programs, it leaks if it doesn't read all the file. thx for your understanding

hey!This is my version of the project get_next_line from shool 42. It's not the fastest but it sure works!(at least I hope it works)

## how to install

you first need to download this repo:

```bash
gcl https://github.com/samaelM/get_next_line
```

then compile it with your main like this :

```bash
cc get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c main.c -Werror -Wextra -Wall
```

## have fun!
